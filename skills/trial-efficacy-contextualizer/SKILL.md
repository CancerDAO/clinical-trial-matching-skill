name: trial-efficacy-contextualizer
description: Use when contextualizing a clinical trial's expected efficacy and comparing against current standard-of-care for the patient's cancer type and treatment line. Triggers when the parent clinical-trial-matching skill needs efficacy snapshots and vs-SoC head-to-head data per decision path. Replaces v1.7.x efficacy_lookup.py + efficacy_database.json + soc_benchmarks.json (which had only 1 CRC SoC entry, leaving most CRC patients with "vs SoC: not available" in their report).

# trial-efficacy-contextualizer

You generate two things per trial:

1. **Efficacy snapshot** — best-available estimate of the trial's expected ORR/PFS/DoR for THIS patient's cancer type and mutation context
2. **vs-SoC head-to-head** — comparison against the patient's current standard-of-care option at this treatment line

## The bug this subskill exists to fix

v1.7.x had `efficacy_database.json` (NCT-level + drug-class baselines) and `soc_benchmarks.json` (cancer × line × molecular subtype). Two failure modes:

1. **CRC SoC table had only 1 entry** (`metastatic_1L_BRAF_V600E`). Every other CRC patient (the vast majority) saw `"vs_soc": {"available": false}` in their report. This is the modal case for CRC — no SoC comparison was ever shown.
2. **Class baselines applied without mutation gating**. NCT06895031 (JYP0015) was tagged "KRAS G12D inhibitor (small molecule)" with G12D PDAC ORR 30%, mPFS 4.5mo applied to a KRAS G12C CRC patient. Nonsensical and misleading.

v2: every efficacy claim must name (cancer × mutation × line) explicitly and either pull a defensible source or admit "no published data for this combination".

  }
}
```

## Process

```
1. Identify trial mechanism + intervention combo
2. Determine patient's effective treatment line and prior therapy classes
3. Search for trial-specific published data (CT.gov citations, recent ASCO/ESMO readouts)
4. If trial-specific data unavailable, find the most-relevant published analog:
   a. Same drug + same cancer + same line → trial_specific match
   b. Same drug + different line → mutation_class_baseline (note caveat)
   c. Same class + same cancer → drug_class_baseline (cancer-specific!)
   d. Same class + different cancer → DO NOT use unless explicitly noted as exploratory
5. List patient's SoC options at current line — use your training knowledge of the cancer's published guidelines (NCCN / CSCO / ESMO) and pivotal trial data
6. Compose head-to-head comparison
```

## Tier hierarchy for evidence

| Tier | Description | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `trial_specific_phase_3` | This exact trial has Phase 3 readout | Highest confidence |
| `trial_specific_phase_2` | This exact trial has Phase 2 interim/final | High confidence |
| `phase_3_rct` | Phase 3 in same drug + same indication | Strong analog |
| `phase_2_published` | Phase 2 in same drug + same indication | Moderate analog |
| `mutation_class_baseline` | Pooled data for same drug class + same mutation + same cancer | Acceptable; flag as "class estimate" |
| `drug_class_baseline_other_cancer` | Same class, different cancer | Use ONLY with explicit cross-cancer caveat |
| `no_data` | No published analog | Honest "no data" — do not invent estimates |

## SoC knowledge source

For the patient's cancer + treatment line, list the relevant SoC options from your training knowledge of NCCN / CSCO / ESMO guidelines and pivotal trials. Prioritize:

- **Approved combos for the patient's molecular subtype first** (e.g. for KRAS G12C mCRC 2L+: sotorasib + panitumumab per CodeBreaK 300, FDA approved 2024)
- **Standard chemo-refractory options** (e.g. for 3L mCRC: regorafenib / TAS-102 ± bevacizumab / fruquintinib)
- **Cancer-specific recent additions** (post-2024 pivotal trial readouts)

Cite trial names + key metrics (ORR, mPFS, mOS) — your output is consumed by downstream synthesis that will surface these to clinicians, who will check citations.

The repo previously shipped per-cancer SoC reference files (`soc-crc-by-line.md` etc.) — these were removed because the LLM has this knowledge in training and the files added maintenance burden without accuracy benefit. If a clinician requests citation lock-in for reproducibility, the user can re-introduce per-cancer SoC rule files.

## Output

- [Output schema](rules/output-efficacy-context-schema.md)

**Batch aggregate (REQUIRED top-level shape — matches trial-gater, trial-risk-annotator):**

```json
{
  "results": [
    { "trial_id": "NCT06459180", "efficacy_snapshot": {...}, "vs_soc": {...} },
    { "trial_id": "ChiCTR2600120786", "efficacy_snapshot": {...}, "vs_soc": {...} }
  ]
}
```

Use `"results"` as the top-level key. Do not invent aliases like `"trials"`, `"items"`, or `"efficacy_results"` — the parent skill's aggregator looks for `results` first. Optional sibling fields (e.g. `soc_anchor_LACC_1L`, `patient_context_summary`) are allowed alongside `results` but the per-trial array MUST live under `results`.

## Mandatory grounding

Before emitting any efficacy number, verify:

1. ✅ The metric comes from a population matching patient (cancer + mutation + line)
2. ✅ The drug class matches the trial's actual intervention (G12D class data ≠ G12C trial)
3. ✅ The citation is a real, locatable source (paper, registry entry, FDA label)
4. ✅ If you're using a class baseline, the class is the RIGHT class for this patient's mutation

If any check fails, emit `"match_type": "no_data"` rather than fabricating.
